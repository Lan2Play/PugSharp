Pugsharp is a PUG System Plugin for CS2 based on the awsome  `CounterStrikeSharp by roflmuffin <https://github.com/roflmuffin/CounterStrikeSharp>`_. 

It's intended purpose is to be used with our fork of `eventula <https://github.com/Lan2Play/eventula-manager>`_, but ofc can be used in a different environment or with different software as well.
If you implement software to interface with PugSharp let us know please!


.. warning::
   This Plugin is in a very early state of development and is not fully working right now! We keep you updated on our discord below, if you are interested in using it.
