Running PugSharp with docker
-------------------------------

Prerequisites
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- `CounterStrikeSharp by roflmuffin <https://github.com/roflmuffin/CounterStrikeSharp>`_  (currently no need to install seperatly, we package it with the releases until there is a steady release cycle available)
- `MetaMod 2.0 <https://www.sourcemm.net/downloads.php?branch=dev>`_
- Linux Dedicated Server


Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Install `MetaMod 2.0 <https://www.sourcemm.net/downloads.php?branch=dev>`_ on your Linux Dedicated Server 
- Download one of our releases including `CounterStrikeSharp by roflmuffin <https://github.com/roflmuffin/CounterStrikeSharp>`_ and the Dotnet Runtime and unpack it to your csgo folder. Currently you can find really early alpha releases on our `Github Actions <https://github.com/Lan2Play/PugSharp/actions>`_ as Artifacts.
- Have fun and report bugs :D

Notes
