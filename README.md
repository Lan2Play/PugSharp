# PugSharp
Pugsharp is a PUG System Plugin for CS2 based on the awsome [CounterStrikeSharp by roflmuffin] (https://github.com/roflmuffin/CounterStrikeSharp). It's intended purpose is to be used with our fork of [eventula] (https://github.com/Lan2Play/eventula-manager), but ofc can be used in a different environment as well.
